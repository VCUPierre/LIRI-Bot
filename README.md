# Description
  •	The LIRI bot is a nodejs app that was created to be a text based natural language interpreter version of Siri. The LIRI bot will      provide end users with information about upcoming concerts from a particular band and or artist, song details, and movie details

# Usage Overview
  •	The app expects a user to provide one of the following commands:
    
    -	Spotify-this-song <song name>
    -	Concert-this <artist/band>
    -	Movie-this <movie title>
    -	Do-what-it-say
    
  •	The app will parse the request and make the corresponding api call to retrieve the data. The data will then be printed to the console for the end-user.
